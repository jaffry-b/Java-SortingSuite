The algorithms from my analysis ranked from best to worst are the following:
Merge Sort
Heap Sort
BinarySearch Insertion Sort
Regular Insertion Sort
Comparable Insertion Sort

This ranking is based off the information and test results. MergeSort continued to show
fastest execution time in the sorting. Heap Sort was not far from MergSort in execution time but did start to lag behind
in the 2^16 sorting execution. BinarySearch was the fastest of the insertion sort algorithms based on its ability to find elements quicker
than regular insertion sort, optimizing the algorithm. Regular Insertion Sort was consistent in its results and had a much larger lead in 
run time compared to Comparable Insertion sort for an array size of 2^16. Comparable was the slowest due to its reliance on the built in compareTo 
method.
